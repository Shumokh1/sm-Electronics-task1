## Overview
This repository contains documentation and code for controlling servo motors to simulate the walking movement of a robot. The project includes two main tasks:

1a) Write an algorithm to operate servo motors to simulate the walking movement of a robot.
1b) Connect and program an electronic circuit containing 6 servo motors using the simulation software.

### 1. Algorithm for Operating Servo Motors
- Describes the step-by-step algorithm to operate servo motors for the walking movement of a robot.

### 2. Connecting and Programming the Circuit
- An electronic circuit with 6 servo motors using Tinkercad software.
